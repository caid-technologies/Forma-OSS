# Forma Export for professional CAD

`forma-core cad-export` creates a local, reproducible ZIP containing an existing
STEP file, explicit metadata, checksums, and an import helper for SOLIDWORKS,
Onshape, or Autodesk Fusion 360. This is a geometry handoff: STEP does not carry
the original native feature tree. No native `.sldprt` or `.f3d` is fabricated.

```sh
forma-core cad-export --capabilities
forma-core cad-export --step assembly.step --metadata cad-metadata.json \
  --target solidworks --output solidworks-handoff.zip
forma-core cad-export --step assembly.step --target onshape --output onshape-handoff.zip
forma-core cad-export --step assembly.step --target fusion360 --output fusion-handoff.zip
```

The source STEP must already exist (for example, from Forma's CAD authoring
workflow). The `dev` branch has no saved native STEP export service or local
`forma-oss` CLI; this addition uses the existing `forma-core` interface and does
not depend on later `main` changes. It adds no browser controls or hosted routes.
Existing output files are rejected. Input is limited to 100 MiB STEP and 1 MiB
metadata. Envelope and checksum checks do not establish solid validity.

Example `cad-metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Sensor bracket",
  "part_number": "BRK-001",
  "revision": "A",
  "description": "Mounting bracket",
  "material": "6061-T6 (reference only)",
  "source_project_id": "my-forma-project",
  "properties": {"finish": "anodized"}
}
```

These fields are optional. Unknown fields, oversized values and credential-like
property names are rejected. Choose CAD properties deliberately; do not pass a
full project export, provider configuration or credentials file as metadata.

| Target | Helper and prerequisites | Native metadata behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SOLIDWORKS | Windows PowerShell + licensed installed SOLIDWORKS; `./import-solidworks.ps1` (`-LegacyImport` if 3D Interconnect is off) | Forma-prefixed document custom properties |
| Onshape | Manual Import, or Python 3 helper with `ONSHAPE_ACCESS_TOKEN` OAuth bearer token and explicit existing document/workspace IDs | Metadata remains in the package sidecar for deliberate mapping to enterprise property schemas |
| Fusion 360 | Installed Fusion; run packaged Python script using Scripts and Add-Ins | Component name, part number, description; full metadata in Forma attributes |

Unzip before running a helper. Onshape example:

```sh
# Set ONSHAPE_ACCESS_TOKEN using your secret manager; never commit it.
python import-onshape.py --document DOCUMENT_ID --workspace WORKSPACE_ID
```

Only this explicit importer invocation sends geometry to Onshape. Upload is not
automatically retried: translation failure, timeout or an ambiguous response
requires checking the workspace before another upload. The helper supports the
standard `cad.onshape.com` service; enterprise-specific hosts need a reviewed
adapter. It refuses redirects so a bearer token cannot follow a changed host.
SOLIDWORKS and Fusion create new unsaved documents. Review and save them yourself.

Material names are references, not density/material-library assignments. Review
scale, body count, solids, orientation, assemblies and metadata mapping in the
target application before using a result downstream. Mates, drawings, original
sketch constraints and native feature history are outside this export contract.
Native application imports require live testing against your licensed versions.

## GrokBot / Cursor host-agent workflow

Forma is an independent, provider-neutral tool. A host agent can discover target
capabilities, obtain the user's CAD target and explicit metadata, invoke the CLI,
then inspect `manifest.json` and the JSON receipt. Cursor can run these commands
in its terminal. GrokBot can use the same CLI when its deployment exposes an
authorized local command runner; no GrokBot-specific API is assumed. Existing
Forma's existing agent interfaces remain available as documented in [agents](agents.md).

Keep credentials in the user's environment and proprietary CAD in the user's
approved workspace. Packaging does not call a model or send model data anywhere.
Any host-agent model use follows that host's data policy. This integration does
not imply a SpaceXAI, xAI, Autodesk, or other vendor partnership or endorsement.

For early enterprise trials, capture target/version, expected versus observed
units/body count, property mappings, translation status and unsupported objects.
Record customer feedback separately from verification evidence; do not label
an untested import as a successful migration.

Offline verification: `python -m unittest tests.integrations.test_cad_export -v`. Tests exercise
packaging, tamper rejection, no-overwrite behavior, and mocked importer control
flow; mocks are not evidence of native CAD compatibility.
